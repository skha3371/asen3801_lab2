% Methodology: Converts the data provided by the ASPEN lab motion capture system into
% the convention used for ASEN 3801:
%   The inertial frame has down as positive z
%   The body frame has x out front, y to the right, z down
%   The angles are the NASA Standard 321 Euler angles
%
% Position data is converted by changing the signs of the y- and z-axes
%
% Attitude data is convereted by calculating the Direction Cosine Matrix
% from the ASPEN helical angles and then determining the Euler angles from
% the DCM. The conversion equations were taken from:
%   https://academicflight.com/articles/kinematics/rotation-formalisms/euler-angles/
